<!-- ### Hello 👋🏼 -->

## Hello <img width="25" align="center" src="https://vardecab.github.io/about-me/icons/nerd-custom.png">

I'm Kuba and you can read more about me by visitng <a href="https://vardecab.github.io/about-me/" target="_blank">my website</a>. Below you can see the things I put together.

<br>

### Newest thing: 

- ⚡ Control Tuya-compatible light bulbs & sockets in you smart home from Windows / macOS computer → <a href="https://github.com/vardecab/control-tuya_smarthome" target="_blank">control-tuya_smarthome</a>

### Big projects: 

- ☔ My biggest project (using 6 different APIs)→ <a href="https://github.com/vardecab/umbrella" target="_blank">Umbrella</a>:
    >A simple weather page that tells you if you need to take an umbrella when going outside ☔ + it shows air quality and allergy information for supported regions. _Currently only in Polish_.

- 🏠 Perhaps my second biggest project (using AI 😱) → <a href="https://github.com/vardecab/flat-finder" target="_blank">flat-finder</a>:
    >Looking for a modern, nicely looking apartment but tired with all these old flats from the '90s? Let's automate that :) <br><br> Scrape apartment offers from OLX․pl, analyse them using artificial intelligence (AI) model to get only good looking flats and (optionally) run IFTTT automation (eg. send email; add a to-do task) when new offers matching search criteria (eg. ≥ 2 rooms, ≤ 2k PLN, ≥ 30m²) are found.

- 💡 My browser extension (to motivate me) → <a href="https://github.com/vardecab/good-manager" target="_blank">Good Manager</a>:
    >Good Manager is a new-tab replacement extension for Chromium-based browsers (eg Google Chrome, Brave, Vivaldi) and acts as a simple way to motivate me to be a better manager by randomly showing specific quotes/phrases from several categories.

- 🚗 My Python project (to find a car) →  <a href="https://github.com/vardecab/otomoto_olx-scraper" target="_blank">otomoto_olx-scraper</a>:
    >Scrape car offers from OTOMOTO․pl & OLX․pl and run IFTTT automation (eg. send email; add a to-do task) when new car(s) matching search criteria is found. With support for native macOS & Windows 10 notifications. 

- 💬 Another Python project I've managed to build (to improve my vocabulary) →  <a href="https://github.com/vardecab/kindle-words" target="_blank">kindle-words</a>:
    >Do something useful with your Kindle notes :) This script extracts individual words from My Clippings file hidden on your Kindle e-reader, translates them using Google Translate and exports the pair "original word" → "translation" into a .txt file from which you can learn these words or import them into an application such as Quizlet.

- 🚚 My first Python module available on PyPI (to give back to community) → <a href="https://github.com/vardecab/win10toast-click" target="_blank">win10toast-click</a>:
    >An easy-to-use Python library for displaying Windows 10 Toast Notifications. Improved version of win10toast and win10toast-persist to include `callback_on_click` to run a function on notification click, for example to open a URL.

### Smaller projects: 

- 📦 And a script to look for updates for my Kindle → <a href="https://github.com/vardecab/kindle-updater" target="_blank">kindle-updater</a>:
    >Script in Python to check if new software version is available for Kindle Paperwhite 4 (or any other model after you change a couple of variables).

- 🐍 And yet another Python one (to save time) → <a href="https://github.com/vardecab/eskarbonka-update" target="_blank">eSkarbonka-update</a>:
    >Periodically check & get a native system notification if value was changed on a website. In this case, get value from my WOŚP's eSkarbonka.
    
- 🤖 And an idea I had... →  <a href="https://github.com/vardecab/emails-from-pdfs" target="_blank">emails-from-pdfs</a>:
    >Extract email addresses from PDFs stored in multiple folders. For example: you can download candidates' CVs from your HR platform and this script will extract all email addresses found in the files.
